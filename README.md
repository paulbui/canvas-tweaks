### TODO List:

* Button in speedgrader to batch load multiple next ungraded student submissions in other tabs
* Button to zero out and mark missing submissions (when the built-in auto-zero does not work for external LTI assignments)
* Button to remove zero and remove missing flag when a student has a submission
