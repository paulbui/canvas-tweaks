# Description
The speedgrader_shortcut_for_submission_page userscript adds a shortcut button to the Speedgrader for an assignmnet's submission page. This is most useful when a submission comment is sent to an instructor's email, and the instructor clicks the "Click here to review the submission" link. The link brings you to the student's submission, but you cannot easily modfiy the Late/Missing/Excused/None status flag from this page. Adding the button allows you to jump to the Speedgrader.
